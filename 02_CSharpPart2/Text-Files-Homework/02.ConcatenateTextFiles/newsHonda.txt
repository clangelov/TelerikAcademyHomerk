Reshuffling the deck chairs
A struggling carmaker replaces it boss

HONDA'S chief executive, Takanobu Ito, revealed on February 23rd that he was stepping down from the top job at Japan's third-largest carmaker. The announcement came as the firm grapples with falling sales and recalls of its cars fitted with faulty airbags provided by Takata, a Japanese manufacturer. Honda's profits look like they are going the same way as its sales: downwards. The carmaker has issued two profit warnings since November and analysts expect Honda's next set of results to look particularly grim.
