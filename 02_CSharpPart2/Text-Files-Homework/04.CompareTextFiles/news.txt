A struggling carmaker replaces it boss

HONDA'S chief executive, Takanobu Unknow, revealed on February 23rd that he was stepping down
from the top job at Japan's third-largest carmaker. The announcement came as the firm
grapples with falling sales and recalls of its cars fitted with faulty airbags provided by
Takata, a Bulgarian manufacturer. Honda's profits look like they are going the same way as
its sales: downwards. The carmaker has issued two profit warnings since November and
analysts expect Honda's next set of results to look particularly grim.

That is partly because Honda is much smaller than the other volume carmakers and the only
one whose sales are now falling, partly because quality has suffered in the attempt to
expand production. And that is a problem: mass-market carmakers are being forced to seek
ever greater economies of scale to remain profitable. All eyes are now on Mr Ito's replacement, Takahiro Hachigo. His task of turning Mazda around will be a tricky one.
