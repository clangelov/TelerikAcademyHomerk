Reshuffling the deck chairs
A struggling carmaker replaces it boss

HONDA'S chief executive, Takanobu Ito, revealed on Feb 23rd that he was stepping down
from the top job at Japan's third-largest carmaker.
Honda's profits look like they are going the same way as its sales: downwards. 
The carmaker has issued two profit warnings since November andanalysts expect Honda's next set of results to look particularly grim.
 
And that is a problem: mass-market carmakers are being forced to seek
ever greater economies of scale to remain profitable. 
All eyes are now on Mr Ito's replacement, Takahiro Hachigo. His task of turning Honda around will be a tricky one.
